        The Veiled Narrative is an online writing platform that aims to break
        barriers and challenge cultural norms surrounding mental health.
        Self-expression is an innate human desire and any hindrance to that
        desire propels silenced voices and buried experiences. For years, South
        Asian society has induced fear and shame, forcing us to suppress our
        identity. We have been conditioned to put up appearances that encourage
        detrimental norms. The negative social attitude towards mental health
        and its ‘fictional’ existence is damaging the very core of our essence.
        The stereotypes attributed to different sects of society are destructive
        to our mental and physical well being. To be able to engage in open
        conversations that question norms and raise awareness are developments
        towards becoming a more understanding society.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our platform is for free expression and seeks to use art as a catalyst
        for change. By engaging in open dialogues, we dare to break outdated
        norms. Together, we can strive to understand, not to judge. In an
        inexpressive society, conversations that challenge stigmas and highlight
        taboo topics are our biggest assets towards making a difference. There
        is strength in expression and unity in sharing our experiences. Strength
        is working up the courage to share your stories so you can inspire
        countless others. Strength is breaking traditions so future generations
        aren't forced to live in the shadows. Strength is in expression.
        <br />
        <br />
        We encourage everyone to use this platform as a means to liberate
        oneself. This is for those who feel silenced, those who have faced
        discrimination, those who dare to be different and those who feel
        confined within their own minds. We encourage you to come forth with
        your experiences and unburden yourself because we are here to listen.
        The goal is to challenge conventions in the smallest of ways to help
        create a society that acknowledges mental health and promotes free
        expression.
